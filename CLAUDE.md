# xpublish-tiles

## Project Overview
This is a tile router for Xpublish - a framework for serving xarray datasets via HTTP APIs.

The goal of this project is to transform xarray datasets to raster tiles, which can then be served via HTTP APIs. In the future this may expand to vector and other types of tiles.

### Key Commands
- **Environment sync**: `uv sync`
- **Type check**: `uv run ty check`
- **Run tests**: `uv run pytest tests`
